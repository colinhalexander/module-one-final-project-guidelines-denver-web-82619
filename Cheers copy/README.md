=======================================================================

Cheers, the CLI app was planned and developed by Amanda Rodgers and Colin Alexander.

# Run instructions: 

To run this application you need the following Ruby gems: -- gem "activerecord" -- gem "sqlite3" -- gem "sinatra" -- gem "sinatra-activerecord" -- gem "require_all" -- gem "pry" -- gem "rest-client" -- gem "tty-prompt" 

(These will be included within the Gemfile once the repo is cloned, if you run into any issues run "bundle install" within your terminal to fix any gem related errors.)

Once the gems are correctly installed run 'ruby runner.rb' in your terminal in order to fire up the game!

# Cheers Overview: 

When the app loads you are directed to a Welcome Page. You can select if you are a New or Returning User. The app allows one to rate beers, leave a review of a beer and to save and record their favorite beers. The user is also able to get a recommendation for a beer.
